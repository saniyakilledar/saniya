      <p>The word "Dharwad" is derived from the Sanskrit word 'dwarawata', 'dwara' meaning "door" and 'wata' or 'wada' meaning "town". It 
        means a place of rest in a long travel or a small habitation. For centuries, Dharwad acted as a resting place for travellers and a 
        gateway between the Malenadu (western mountains) and the Bayalu Seeme (plains)</p>

        Navalur guavas are famous crops.</p1>
