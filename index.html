      <p>The word "Dharwad" is derived from the Sanskrit word 'dwarawata', 'dwara' meaning "door" and 'wata' or 'wada' meaning "town". It 
        means a place of rest in a long travel or a small habitation. For centuries, Dharwad acted as a resting place for travellers and a 
        gateway between the Malenadu (western mountains) and the Bayalu Seeme (plains)</p>
      <p1>Dharwad cultivates a variety of crops like Dharwad Cotton Hybrid (DCH) which was invented by University of Agricultural Sciences,
        Dharwad. In addition to this, Dharwad produces varieties of channa, soya and groundnut seeds. Paddy, jowar, Alphonso mangoes and 
        Navalur guavas are famous crops.</p1>
